# TEC-1 Hellschreiber 
...see wiki

Hellschreiber is a machine-readable teleprinter communication that uses a combination of on and off dots to represent characters, similar to the way Morse code uses dots and dashes. It was invented in the 1920s and was commonly used in the 1930s and 1940s for telegraph communication. Instead of printing the characters on a sheet of paper, Hellschreiber displays the characters on a screen, making it a form of visual telegraphy. It was used in both point-to-point communication and for broadcasting messages over radio waves.
