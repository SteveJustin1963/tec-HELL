TEC-1 Hellschreiber


Hellschreiber is a machine-readable teleprinter code that was used in the early days of telecommunications. It was invented in 1918 by Rudolf Hell, a German engineer. Hellschreiber was used extensively during World War II by the German military. After the war, Hellschreiber fell out of use in favor of more modern teleprinter codes such as Baudot and ASCII. However, it has experienced a resurgence in recent years as a means of sending text messages over amateur radio. Hellschreiber transmits each character as a series of dots and dashes. The code is read by a machine that prints out the characters on a sheet of paper. One advantage of Hellschreiber over other teleprinter codes is that it can be used with a simple Morse code keyer. This makes it ideal for use in amateur radio communications. Hellschreiber is also less susceptible to interference than other teleprinter codes. This is because the dots and dashes are printed on the paper, rather than being transmitted electronically.
What are the disadvantages of Hellschreiber? One disadvantage of Hellschreiber is that it is slower than other teleprinter codes. This is because each character must be transmitted as a series of dots and dashes. Another disadvantage is that Hellschreiber is not as widely used as other teleprinter codes. This means that there are fewer people who are able to read and write the code.

### Project

- a tec1 controlled Hell tx and rx and printer/display system
- tx/rx from MINT keypad or Hex pad 
- print to paper tape, 7seg, LCD matrix, small thermal printer  
- backup transmission to audio tape to print later
